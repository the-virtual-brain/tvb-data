TVB Data
========

Various demonstration datasets for use with The Virtual Brain are provided here.

Here you will find:
* compatible file/folder structures that can be uploaded thorugh the web interface of TVB; and
* the default datasets used when working in ``console`` or `library` mode.

This package should be treated as a regular Python module.

Possibly what you want to do after cloning it locally from GitHub (https://github.com/the-virtual-brain/tvb-data) is::

    cd tvb-data/
    python setup.py develop

to have it linked into your current Python environment.

`tvb-data` also is shared on Pypi, but it has fewer files, due to size restrictions there.
To work with this package from pypi, run::

    pip install tvb-data
